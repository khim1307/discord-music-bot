Last Updated: [Date]

Welcome to WFJ Bot (the "Bot", "Service"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Bot within the Discord platform. By using the Bot, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Bot.

1. Description of Service
WFJ Bot is a Discord bot designed to provide music playback features (primarily searching SoundCloud, with the ability to attempt playback from YouTube URLs), audio effects (bass boost, 8D), queue management, and server administration functions (kick, ban, clear messages) through slash commands and interactive buttons. The Service is provided "as-is" without warranties of any kind.

2. Acceptable Use
You agree not to use the Bot to:

Request or share content that is illegal, harmful, abusive, harassing, defamatory, infringing, or otherwise objectionable.

Violate any applicable laws or regulations.

Violate Discord's Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.

Spam commands or otherwise disrupt the Bot's operation or the experience of other users.

Attempt to exploit, reverse engineer, or gain unauthorized access to the Bot or its underlying systems.

Use administrative commands (/kick, /ban, /clear) maliciously or without proper authority within the server.

3. Content from Third Parties
The Bot fetches audio content based on your requests from third-party services like SoundCloud and YouTube.

The Bot does not host or own this content.

You are responsible for ensuring that your requests comply with the terms of service and copyright policies of these third-party services.

The availability and legality of content provided by these services are beyond the Bot's control.

The Bot does not endorse any content played through its service.

4. Bot Availability and Modifications
We strive to keep the Bot operational but do not guarantee uninterrupted service. The Bot may be unavailable due to maintenance, technical issues, or other factors. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Bot's functionality at any time without notice.

5. Termination and Blocking
We reserve the right to block individual users or entire servers from using the Bot if they violate these Terms, Discord's Terms of Service, or engage in abusive behavior towards the Bot or other users. Server administrators may also remove the Bot from their server at any time.

6. Disclaimer of Warranties
THE BOT IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE BOT WILL BE ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR ALWAYS AVAILABLE.

7. Limitation of Liability
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WFJ TEAM SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (a) YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE BOT; (b) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE; OR (c) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.

8. Changes to Terms
We may revise these Terms from time to time. The most current version will always be available. We may notify users of significant changes (e.g., via a bot status message or command). By continuing to use the Bot after changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
