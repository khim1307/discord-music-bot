Privacy Policy for WFJ Bot
Last Updated: 04/03/2025

This Privacy Policy describes how [Your Bot Name] ("Bot", "we", "us") collects, uses, and handles information when you interact with the Bot on Discord. Your privacy is important to us. By using the Bot, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

1. Information We Collect

We collect information necessary for the Bot to function correctly:

User Provided Information:

User IDs, Guild (Server) IDs, Channel IDs: Collected automatically via Discord's API when you interact with the Bot (e.g., use slash commands, click buttons) to identify you, the server, and the channel for processing commands and responses.

Command Content: The text and parameters you provide in slash commands (e.g., search terms for /play, user mentions and reasons for /kick or /ban, amount for /clear).

Automatically Collected Information:

Voice State Information: When you use commands like /join, the Bot accesses your current voice channel information via Discord's API to connect to the correct channel.

Interaction Data: Information about your interactions with buttons (e.g., which button was clicked).

Server Logs: The Bot runs on a server managed by the operator ([Your Name/Contact Info]). Standard server logs may be generated that include timestamps, interacting User IDs, Guild IDs, Channel IDs, command usage, IP addresses connecting to the server (typically only the operator's IP if managed via SSH, or Discord's IPs), and potentially error details which might include command parameters. These logs are primarily used for monitoring, troubleshooting, and security purposes.

Information from Third Parties:

We do not directly request personal information from third-party services like SoundCloud or YouTube.

However, when you request music playback via search or URL, the necessary query (search term or URL) is sent to the respective service (yt-dlp library handles this) to find and retrieve the audio stream information. These services operate under their own privacy policies.

2. How We Use Information

We use the collected information solely for the following purposes:

To Operate and Maintain the Bot: Responding to commands, connecting to voice channels, playing audio, managing the music queue and effects, executing administrative actions (/kick, /ban, /clear).

To Process Interactions: Handling button clicks for music controls.

To Troubleshoot and Improve: Analyzing server logs to identify errors, debug issues, monitor performance, and improve the Bot's functionality.

To Enforce Terms: Investigating potential violations of our Terms of Service.

3. How We Share Information

We do not sell your personal information. We only share information in the following limited circumstances:

With Discord's API: Information is inherently shared with Discord as needed to receive commands and send responses according to their API terms and developer policies.

With Third-Party Music Services: Search queries or URLs are sent to services like SoundCloud (or YouTube, if enabled) via the yt-dlp library to fulfill music requests. No User IDs are explicitly sent with these requests by the Bot.

For Legal Reasons: We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency), but only to the extent necessary and legally permissible.

4. Data Storage and Security

In-Memory Data: Most operational data (music queues, current audio effects settings, voice client status) is stored in the Bot's active memory while it is running. This data is volatile and is typically lost when the Bot restarts.

Server Logs: As mentioned in Section 1, logs containing interaction data and potentially IP addresses are stored on the server hosting the Bot ([Your VPS Provider, e.g., Oracle Cloud]). The operator ([Your Name/Contact Info]) is responsible for implementing standard security measures for this server. Log data is retained until manually cleared or rotated according to the server's configuration.

We implement reasonable measures to protect the information handled by the Bot itself, but no internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

5. Data Retention

We retain collected information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy:

In-memory data is retained only for the duration of the Bot's current running session.

Server logs are retained according to the operator's server configuration and maintenance practices.

6. User Rights

Since most data processed directly by the bot is transient (in-memory) or necessary for basic Discord interaction (IDs provided by Discord), options for managing your data typically involve:

Leaving servers where the Bot is present.

Contacting the Bot operator @khimmmm on Discord with specific concerns or requests regarding data potentially stored in server logs.

7. Children's Privacy
The Bot is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or 16 in certain jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under these ages. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us immediately.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version will always be available. We may notify users of significant changes. Your continued use of the Bot after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.

9. Contact Information
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact me @khimmmm on Discord.
